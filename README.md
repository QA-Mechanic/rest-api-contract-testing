## Overview

This guide provides a **step-by-step process** for implementing Contract Testing in your development workflow. Contract testing ensures API compatibility between consumer and provider services, reducing integration issues and enabling confident deployments.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Access to Pactflow broker
- Target API endpoint (JSONPlaceholder used in examples)
- Basic understanding of API testing concepts

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define Contract Requirements

**Objective:** Analyze and document the consumer application's API dependencies

**Implementation Process:**
- ‚úÖ Examine the target API structure (JSONPlaceholder in our case)
- ‚úÖ **Identify essential response fields:** `userId`, `id`, `title`, `body`
- ‚úÖ Document expected data types and response formats
- ‚úÖ Establish clear integration requirements

### Step 2: Develop Consumer Tests

**Objective:** Create comprehensive tests that specify API expectations using Pact matchers

**Implementation Example:**

```javascript
// Consumer test defining the contract specifications
await provider.addInteraction({
  state: 'posts exist',
  uponReceiving: 'a request to get all posts',
  withRequest: {
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/posts'
  },
  willRespondWith: {
    status: 200,
    body: eachLike({
      userId: like(1),
      id: like(1),
      title: like('Sample Post Title'),
      body: like('Sample post content')
    })
  }
});
```

### Step 3: Execute Consumer Tests Against Mock Server

**Objective:** Validate consumer behavior against Pact's mock server implementation

**Command:**
```bash
npm run test:consumer
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- ‚úÖ Consumer tests pass successfully
- ‚úÖ **Contract files are generated** in the `/pacts` directory
- ‚úÖ Mock server validates consumer's ability to handle expected responses
- ‚úÖ Test coverage demonstrates proper error handling

### Step 4: Generate Contract Artifacts

**Objective:** Automatically create formal contract documentation from successful test execution

**Generated Assets:**
- üìÑ **JSON contract file:** `test-app-consumer-jsonplaceholder-provider.json`
- üìã Formal contract specifications with request/response expectations
- üîß Flexible matching rules utilizing `like()` matchers
- üìö Versioned contract documentation for team reference

### Step 5: Publish Contracts to Pactflow Broker

**Objective:** Upload contracts to centralized repository for team collaboration

**Command:**
```bash
CONSUMER_VERSION="2.0.0" npm run publish:contracts
```

**Business Benefits:**
- üè¢ **Centralized contract storage** and management
- üìù Version control and historical tracking
- üë• Enhanced team visibility and collaboration
- ‚ö° Streamlined integration workflows

### Step 6: Provider Verification Process

**Objective:** Validate real provider API compliance with published consumer contracts

**Command:**
```bash
PROVIDER_VERSION="2.0.0" npm run test:provider
```

**Verification Workflow:**
1. Download contracts from Pactflow broker
2. Execute HTTP requests against JSONPlaceholder API
3. **Compare actual responses** with contract specifications
4. Report verification results to Pactflow for tracking

### Step 7: Monitor Compatibility Matrix

**Objective:** Review consumer-provider compatibility status through Pactflow dashboard

**Access Point:** [Pactflow Dashboard](https://thredd-c7014ac2.pactflow.io/matrix/provider/jsonplaceholder-provider/consumer/test-app-consumer?consumer%5Bbranch%5D=&provider%5Bversion%5D=&provider%5Bbranch%5D=&provider%5Benvironment%5D=&provider%5Btag%5D=)

**Status Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ **Green:** Consumer and provider are fully compatible
- ‚ùå **Red:** Breaking changes detected, requires attention
- ‚ùì **Gray:** Verification pending or incomplete

### Step 8: Deployment Readiness Assessment

**Objective:** Utilize commands below to ensure safe production deployments, increment the version before deploying

**Commands:**
```bash
$env:CONSUMER_VERSION="2.0.4"
npm run clean:pacts        # Cleans local files
npm run test:consumer      # Generates pacts locally
npm run publish:contracts  # Creates: Pact entry (version 2.0.4)
npm run test:provider      # Creates: Verification entry (version 2.0.4)
```

## Contract Testing Workflow

### **PHASE 1: CONSUMER DEVELOPMENT**
- Requirements Analysis
- Test Development

### **PHASE 2: CONTRACT GENERATION**
- Test Execution
- Contract Artifact Creation

### **PHASE 3: CONTRACT PUBLISHING**
- Broker Upload
- Version Management

### **PHASE 4: PROVIDER VERIFICATION**
- Contract Download
- API Validation

### **PHASE 5: DEPLOYMENT DECISION**
- **Compatibility Check**
- **Release Authorization**

## Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose | Phase |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `npm run test:consumer` | Execute consumer tests | Testing |
| `npm run publish:contracts` | Upload contracts to broker | Publishing |
| `npm run test:provider` | Verify provider compliance | Verification |
| `npm run clean:pacts` | Clean local contract files | Maintenance |

## Key Benefits

- üõ°Ô∏è **Reduced Integration Issues:** Catch breaking changes early
- üöÄ **Confident Deployments:** Ensure API compatibility before release
- üìä **Centralized Monitoring:** Track all consumer-provider relationships
- ‚ö° **Faster Development:** Parallel development with contract confidence

***

**Note:** This implementation uses JSONPlaceholder as the example API provider. Adapt the endpoints and contract specifications to match your specific API requirements abc.
