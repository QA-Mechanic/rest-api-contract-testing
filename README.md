Contract Testing Implementation: Step-by-Step Process 

Here's a comprehensive overview of the Consumer-Driven Contract Testing workflow with a professional yet accessible approach. 

Complete Contract Testing Process 

Step 1: Define Contract Requirements 

Objective: Analyze and document the consumer application's API dependencies 

Implementation Process: 

Examine the target API structure (JSONPlaceholder in our case) 

Identify essential response fields: userId, id, title, body 

Document expected data types and response formats 

Establish clear integration requirements 

Step 2: Develop Consumer Tests 

Objective: Create comprehensive tests that specify API expectations using Pact matchers 

Implementation Example: 

Javascript code -  

// Consumer test defining the contract specifications 
await provider.addInteraction({ 
 state: 'posts exist', 
 uponReceiving: 'a request to get all posts', 
 withRequest: { method: 'GET', path: '/posts' }, 
 willRespondWith: { 
   status: 200, 
   body: eachLike({ 
     userId: like(1), 
     id: like(1),  
     title: like('Sample Post Title'), 
     body: like('Sample post content') 
   }) 
 } 
}); 
 

Step 3: Execute Consumer Tests Against Mock Server 

Objective: Validate consumer behavior against Pact's mock server implementation 

Command: npm run test: consumer 

Expected Outcomes: 

Consumer tests pass successfully. 

Contract files are generated in the /pacts directory 

Mock server validates consumer's ability to handle expected responses 

Test coverage demonstrates proper error handling 

Step 4: Generate Contract Artifacts 

Objective: Automatically create formal contract documentation from successful test execution 

Generated Assets: 

JSON contract file: test-app-consumer-jsonplaceholder-provider.json 

Formal contract specifications with request/response expectations 

Flexible matching rules utilizing like () matchers 

Versioned contract documentation for team reference 

Step 5: Publish Contracts to Pactflow Broker 

Objective: Upload contracts to centralized repository for team collaboration 

Command: CONSUMER_VERSION="2.0.0" npm run publish:contracts 

Business Benefits: 

Centralized contract storage and management 

Version control and historical tracking 

Enhanced team visibility and collaboration 

Streamlined integration workflows 

Step 6: Provider Verification Process 

Objective: Validate real provider API compliance with published consumer contracts 

Command: PROVIDER_VERSION="2.0.0" npm run test:provider 

Verification Workflow: 

Download contracts from Pactflow broker 

Execute HTTP requests against JSONPlaceholder API 

Compare actual responses with contract specifications 

Report verification results to Pactflow for tracking 

Step 7: Monitor Compatibility Matrix 

Objective: Review consumer-provider compatibility status through Pactflow dashboard 

Access Point: https://thredd-c7014ac2.pactflow.io/pacticipants/jsonplaceholder-provider/versions/2.0.0?branch=main 

Status Indicators: 

✅ Green: Consumer and provider are fully compatible 

❌ Red: Breaking changes detected, requires attention 

❓ Gray: Verification pending or incomplete 

Step 8: Deployment Readiness Assessment 

Objective: Utilize below command to ensure safe production deployments, just increment the version before deploying. 

Command: 

 

npm run clean:pacts && \ 

CONSUMER_VERSION=“2.0.1” npm run test:consumer && \ 

CONSUMER_VERSION=“2.0.1” npm run publish:contracts && \ 

PROVIDER_VERSION=“2.0.1” npm run test:provider
